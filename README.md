## What it does

It's a timed quiz game that tests the users knowledge of the popular First-Person-Shooter game Valorant. 
It keeps track of the users answers. If the answer is correct the player gets a point. If the wrong answer is wrong they are given a time penalty.
At the end of the game the players score is saved to localStorage and they are given a prompt asking if they'd like to play again or return to the home screen.

### Known Issues

I wasn't able to implement the localStorage to save user's scores as a result the button to view previous scores isn't functional.
