            <p>
                This quiz tests how much you know about the First-Person-Shooter Valorant.<br>
                Do you know your Agents? Do you know your weapons? What about the different skin lines?<br>
                Is your knowledge Iron level? Or is it worthy of the Radiant title?<br>
                Put your skills to the test and see where you stack up.<br>

                Great job, you made it through the quiz!<br>
                Now that you've tested yourself you should try again<br>
                if you're not satisfied with your score.
